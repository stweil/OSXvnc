Vine VNC Server (OSXvnc)
========================

The code in this Git repository is based on the CVS repository at
http://osxvnc.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/osxvnc/.
It was created using this command:

    git cvsimport -d :pserver:anonymous@osxvnc.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/osxvnc OSXvnc

Vine was developed at Redstone Software which was acquired by TestPlant.

This is a modified private copy of the original software.
