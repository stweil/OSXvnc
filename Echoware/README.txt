                      ===============================

INTRODUCTION
------------
EchoWare is an OSX bundle that enables both client-server as 
well as peer-to-peer applications to communicate with each other 
via a "relay server" (aka, an "echoServer"). All communication 
between echoWare and the echoserver appears to be outgoing TCP 
from the point of view of the OSX network. This allows the 
echoWare-enabled applications to communicate with each other 
without either side of the connection needing to set or adjust 
any firewall or router's port-forwarding settings.

EchoWare is utilized in both the Kaboodle "Network Manager 
and Personal VPN application", as well as in EchoVNC, a
firewall-friendly VNC Server and Viewer. For more details on 
these projects, please visit our website at:

EchoWare includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project
for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit. (http://www.openssl.org/)
