</p><p><b><A name=Clients>Q: OSXvnc is only a server, where's the client to connect to my machine?<a></b></p><p><b>A: </b>That's right OSXvnc is only a server, there are already a number of good VNC Clients available for OS X, we recommend these:<BR><a href="http://cotvnc.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Chicken Of The VNC</a><BR><a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/11993" target="_blank">VNCThing</a></span><BR><a href="http://www.mdimension.com/" target="_blank">VNCDimension</a></span></p>

<p><b><A name=External>Q: How can I connect to my home machine from outside my home?<a></b></p><p><b>A: </b>First, is your machine behind a device that does NAT like a Firewall, Router or Cable/DSL modem then please read the following FAQ.  If not then, you need to get the IP address of your computer, it will be shown in the System Prefernces application under Network and will consist of four numbers with dots between them.  In your VNC client just use this number to connect to your computer from an external network.  You can also go to this handy link from the machine running OSXvnc to verify the IP address: <a href=http://www.gotomyvnc.com/ target=_blank>http://www.gotomyvnc.com<a><BR>
</span></p>

<p><b><A name=NAT>Q: How can I connect to a machine that is behind a Cable/DSL Modem or NAT Firewall?</a></b></p><p><b>A: </b>When working through a network address translation (NAT) device like a Cable/DSL Modem, Router, or Firewall you will need to setup "Port Forwarding" on the device to forward the VNC port (5900 by default) from that device to the internal IP address of the machine running OSXvnc (the internal IP will look like 192.168.X.X, 10.X.X.X, or 127.0.0.X). Please read your devices documentation for further details on setting up port forwarding.<BR><BR>
Not all devices offer port forwarding, for those that do not, you can set your Mac to be the designated DMZ host for the NAT but this has the effect of forwarding ALL ports from the internet to your Macintosh.  If you need to go this route we highly recommend you <a href=#Firewall>enable the Firewall on your Mac OS X machine and ONLY allow port 5900 to pass through</a>.<BR><BR>
Once the VNC port is direct toward your Macintosh you should be able to connect via an external VNC client to your Network's External (or WAN) IP address.  This number will be substantially different from the internal IP of your computer and can usually be found by looking at the modem configuration information or else by visiting this handy page from the machine running OSXvnc: <a href=http://www.gotomyvnc.com/ target=_blank>http://www.gotomyvnc.com</a>

<p><b><A name=TIGER>Q: I've configured OSXvnc as a Startup using the latest 10.4 TIGER Preview Seed and it isn't starting up?<a></b></p><p><b>A: </b>It's a permissions problem that is addressed in version 1.5 of OSXvnc.  We rcommend updating to the latest OSXvnc.<BR></span></p>

<p><b><A name=BindSocket>Q: When I start OSXvnc it stops immediately with the error: "Unable to Bind Socket"?<a></b></p><p><b>A: </b>This means that OSXvnc can't listen on the specified port, this is almost always because another VNC is already listening, often because OSXvnc has already been set as a startup item.  You can check to see with the following Terminal command:<BR><code>ps -auxwww | grep -i '[v]nc'</code><BR>If this reports anything then vnc is probably already running, read the FAQ <A href=#DisableStartup><I>"I've setup OSXvnc as a Startup item, how can I turn it off"</I></a> for instructions on how to stop it.</span></p>

<p><b><A name=Firewall>Q: OSXvnc is running but I can't connect to it/How do I configure my Firewall to allow OSXvnc?</a></b></p><p><b>A: </b>If you don't see anything in the OSXvnc log then your network isn't allowing the connection.  The most likely cause of this is that your MaxOS X machine is running the built-in firewall.  You can configure the firewall to allow port 5900 (or whichever port VNC is running on). Using the System Preferences application go to Sharing and then Firewall. On that panel, "Add.." another service for port 5900 and call it VNC</span></p>
<p><b><A name=APE>Q: The OSXvnc application launches fine the first time but after that it just bounces in the Dock and never launches?<A></b></p><p><b>A: </b>This is most likely because you are running APE from unsanity.org.  In some situations APE can corrupt the OSXvnc bundle to the point where it can no longer function.  Try adding the OSXvnc application to the "exclude" list in the Ape Manager preference pane and re-installing OSXvnc. If that does not solve your problem please contact support at <a href=mailto:urgent@unsanity.org>urgent@unsanity.org</A>.</span></p><p><b><A name=CLI>Q: How can I start upOSXvnc from a command line?</A></b></p><p><b>A: </b> To startup OSXvnc from command line, go inside the Applicationdirectory(OSXvnc.app) and launch the OSXvnc-server process.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To change parameters you will need togive it arguments (-rfbport to set port, -vncauth to specify a password file,etc).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For usage run the commandwith -help. For example:</span><BR><code>/Applications/OSXvnc.app/osxvnc-server -rfbport 5901</code></p><p><b><A name=FUS>Q: I'm using 10.3 (Panther) and when I do a Fast User Switch I'm no longer able to control the remote machine.</A></b></p><p><b>A: </b>This is a know bug in Apple's control API.  It was probably designed with security in mind and attempts to work past it by allowing authentication, etc have not been succesful.  We hope to discuss this problem with Apple and have a good solution in the future.  In the meantime, you must switch back to the original user or else launch a new server, perhaps via command line, to connect to.</span></p>

<p><b><A name=OS9>Q: OSXvnc is only for OS X, what about OS 9?</A></b></p><p><b>A: </b>Redstone Software also offers OS9vnc, it can be downloaded here:<BR><a href="http://www.redstonesoftware.com/Download/OS9vnc.sit" target="_blank">http://www.redstonesoftware.com/Download/OS9vnc.sit</a><BR>NOTE: At this time closing the OS9vnc log window will shutdown the server - please leave the log window running.</p><p><b><A name=NoDisplay>Q: When trying to launch OSXvnc command line it fails with the error kCGErrorIllegalArgument : initCGDisplayState: cannot map display interlocks.</A></b></p><p><b>A: </b>This happens if you try to launch as an unpriviledged user in 10.2 or earlier. A priviledged user is either the user who is currently logged into the GUI or the ROOT user.  Try using su (or configuring the application to autostart using the start-up item)</span></p><p><b><A name=International>Q: I am using anInternational keyboard (or keyboard layout) and the characters don't come upappropriately.</a></b></p><p><b>A: </b>Currently OSXvnc doesn't handle this as well as wewould like. Part of the problem is that if both the remote and local users areusing an international keyboard layout the keystrokes actually getdouble-corrected, thus producing the standard US keys. Try setting one of thekeyboards back to US; this works a bit better.</span></p><p><b><A name=WebServer>Q: Is there a WebServer with OSXvnc or a Java applet integrated into OSXvnc?</A></b></p><p><b>A: </b>No, but you can download a Java applet client andput it somewhere on the MacOS X machine's web-served directory.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then enable web serving on your machineand access the Java applet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wedidn't port the Java applet, but a copy of it can be <a href="vncjava.tgz">downloadedhere</a>. </span><b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></b></p><p><b><A name=x2vnc>Q: I'm using x2vnc or win2vnc and it seems slow.  Is there a way to run OSXvnc without the slowdown from having the screen updates sent?</A></b></p><p><b>A: </b>Due to a problem in some of the Apple update routines the entire server must be launched in such a way that it doesn't register for screen updates ever.  Currently you can only do this by launching in command line mode and using the argument 
<code>-noupdates</code></p>

<p><b><A name=SSH>Q: How can I have myconnection to OSXvnc tunnel through SSH?</A></b></p><p><b>A: </b>Since MacOS X ships with SSH support built in this ispretty easy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First you will wantto make sure your VNC machine has SSH running. You can turn this on in theSystem Preferences -&gt; Sharing Panel by checking the box for &quot;RemoteLogin&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then you need an SSHclient on the machine you want to connect from (again, it's there by default onMacOS X). For the rest of the instructions read the VNC page <ahref="http://www.uk.research.att.com/archive/vnc/sshvnc.html">http://www.uk.research.att.com/archive/vnc/sshvnc.html</a></span><b>.</b><span style='font-weight:normal'><BR>If you use the "-localhost" option inOSXvnc you will need to literally specify "127.0.0.1" when you make your sshport forwarding call, like this example:<br><code>ssh -L 5905:127.0.0.1:5900 mydomain.com</code><BR>NOTE: In MacOS 10.3 (Panther) localhost is defined as it's IPv6 version - this doesn't work for VNC so specify 127.0.0.1</span><b></b></p>

<p><b><A name=MultipleMonitors>Q: Does OSXvnc support multiple displays?</A></b></p><p><b>A: </b>Officially OSXvnc does not support multiple monitors at this time, it is on our list of future enhancements.<BR>We do have a BETA feature for view only on displays besides the primary display.   This feature is available only from command line.  If you launch OSXvnc with the arguments<BR><code>"-disableRemoteEvents -display" #displayNumber#<BR></code> then that VNC server will serve the display associated with that number, unfortunately you must disable events becaue the event translation logic has not yet been added.</span></p>

<p><b><A name=MultipleSessions>Q: Can I setup OSXvnc to allow a remote user to work in his own desktop without disrupting the user at the machine(like X-Windows)?</A></b></p><p><b>A: </b>In a word, no.  This is a limitation of the Mac OS X window server which currently only allows a single desktop session to be active.  Even Mac OS 10.3's Fast User Switching only allows you to temporarily store a desktop session, only one session remains active at any given time.  If you would like to see this feature please send requests directly to Apple.</span></p>
<p><b><A name=Headless>Q: I'm running a headlessMacOS X machine and OSXvnc doesn't work.</A></b></p><p><b>A: </b>When Mac OS X starts up on older systems it will disable certain video functions when no monitor is plugged in. We are looking at ways to solve this in OSXvnc, but for the time being you canpurchase a dongle that makes the Mac OS X machine think that a monitor is pluggedin.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><a href="http://www.drbott.com/prod/db.lasso?code=0101-GHED">DrBott has one called gHEAD available here</a>.</span></p><p><b><A name=StartupItem>Q: How can I setupOSXvnc as a boot-time Startup Itme without needing a user logged in?</A></b></p><p><b>A: </b>OSXvnc 1.3 and above can setup this mode for you.  Please go to the "Startup" panel and press the "Setup Startup Item" button.  You will need to authenticate as a user with privilege to administer the machine.  Once you have, OSXvnc will set itself to start up the next time your machine boots.  In this mode you don't use the GUI application, it will just be running all the time.<BR>If you want to do it by hand you will need to copy the OSXvnc.app/Contents/Resources/OSXvnc folder into /Library/StartupItems and then modify the OSXvnc file by hand.<BR><B>NOTE:</B> Due to Apple security restrictions this server will NOT have access to the pasteboard (Cut&Paste) between machines</span></p><p><b><a name=DisableStartup>Q: I've setup OSXvnc as a Startup item, how can I turn it off?</A></b></p><p><b>A: </b>Starting with 1.32 the GUI can do this for you on the Startup tab.  If you want to turn it off temporarily but have it continue to startup then you want to issue the following command:<BR><code>sudo /Library/StartupItems/OSXvnc/OSXvnc stop</code><BR>If you want to stop OSXvnc from starting up automatically any longer you can also remove the startup directory.  This command will do that:<BR><code>sudo rm -rf /Library/StartupItems/OSXvnc</code><BR></span></p><p><b><A name=Executables>Q: Where arethe storepasswd and OSXvnc-server executables?</A></b></p><p><b>A: </b> The OSXvnc-server and storepasswd executables arenow stored in the /Contents/MacOS directory and are linked from the rootOSXvnc.app directory as well as the /Contents/Resources directory. Thisprevents the GUI from launching a second dock icon when they are executed. </span></p><p><b><A name=Logout>Q: I've set up OSXvncas a boot-time Statup Item but when a user logs out it breaks the server.</A></b></p><p><b>A: </b>This should be fixed with the 1.11 version of the startupscript so that at least the server restarts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a workaround for a behavior in MacOS X that kills all user processes when a user logs out.</p><p><b><A name=Source>Q: OSXvnc is opensource, so....where's the source?</A></b></p><p><b>A: </b>Our source code is available at Sourceforge via CVS. Please try it at: <ahref="http://sourceforge.net/projects/osxvnc/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/osxvnc</a><b>.</b></p><p><b><A name=Future>Q: What are youlooking at adding for future versions?</A></b></p><p><b>A: </b>Outside of bugs fixes, on our list at the moment (in some rough approximation of order) are...<UL><LI>Adding support for Reverse Connections (in BETA)</LI><LI>Adding support for Server Side Scaling  (in BETA)</LI><LI>Adding support for Multiple Monitor Support</LI><LI>Improving the Fast User Switch Behavior</LI><LI>Improving Statup Item (System Prefs Pane, fixing Pasteboards, and the shutdown on logout thing)</LI><LI>Improving International Keyboard support</LI><LI>G5, Multiprocessor, and Altivec specific performance enhancements</LI></UL></p><p><b><A name=Developer>Q: I'm a developerand would like to help with OSXvnc.</A></b></p><p><b>A: </b>Great!&nbsp;Please send email to <a href="mailto:%20osxvnc@redstonesoftware.com">osxvnc@redstonesoftware.com</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>
